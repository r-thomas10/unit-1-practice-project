    <main><p>Hi! I'm Rachel. I'm currently an actively serving paramedic with a private ambulance company. I hope to continue to challenge myself in an entirely new career path and continue advancing.</p>
    
    <h2 id="my-start">How I got my start</h2>
    <p>I actually got introduced to coding by  my sister who is also former alumni for GC! She showed me a different yet still equally as challenging path and I became very interested in the field.</p>
    <p>As I stated my sister is former alumni. She talked to me about her own personal experience at Grand Circus and how helpful the environemnt and teachers were. The assistance she received on the way to help her land a job in tech before she had even graduated.</p>
